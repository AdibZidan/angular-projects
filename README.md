# Angular-Projects

This project is live. Head over [here](http://www.adibzidan.com) to access it.

This repository includes my Portfolio, About Me and Task-Manager; which are a work in progress.

The Task-Manager is built using Angular 8 and is already CRUD ready.

For the Back-End, I'm using Node.JS; which is in a private repository.

## Instructions:

Make sure to install the latest version of:
- [Node.JS & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Accomplishments:

- Portfolio, About Me & Task Manager are fully responsive
- Basic tests for each Component
- Dynamic SCSS mixins
