# Angular-Projects

This repository includes my Portfolio and Task-Manager; which are a work in progress.

The Task-Manager is built using Angular 8 and is already CRUD ready.

For the Back-End, I'm using Node.JS.

## What I've learned

- Connecting Front-End with Back-End
- CRUD: *Create*, *Read*, *Update* & *Delete*
- Angular Material : Dialog
- Angular animations
- Un/Subscribing
- HTTP methods
- Node.JS
- Responsive Design
- Documentation
- & **many more**!
