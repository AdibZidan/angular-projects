# My Personal Portfolio

This project is live. Head over [here](https://www.adibzidan.com) to access it.

This repository includes my Portfolio, About Me and Task-Manager.

The Task-Manager is built using Angular 12 and is already CRUD ready.

~~For the Back-End, I'm using Node.JS; which is in a private repository.~~

As of August 10th, 2021, I've replaced the Back-End with the NgRx state framework.

## Instructions:

Make sure to install the latest version of:
- [Node.JS & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Run `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies

## Accomplishments:

- Portfolio, About Me & Task Manager are fully responsive
- Basic & more in depth tests for each Component
- Dynamic SCSS mixins
- Deployed with HTTPS
