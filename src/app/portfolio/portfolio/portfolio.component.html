  <p>My name is Adib Zidan and I'm Syrian/Ukrainian. I'm 24 years old and I've been living in Austria for the past 5
    years.</p>
  <p>I'm also an upcoming Front-End Developer based in Vienna who'll graduate
    on the 28th of June from <a href="https://www.newaustriancodingschool.at/" target="_blank"><em>New Austrian Coding
        School</em></a> !</p>

  <p>I'm more than grateful to be given this one in a life time opportunity to become a developer in the near future. My
    life motto is 'always Kaizen' which is a Japanese word, that means 'Change for better'.</p>
